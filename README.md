# Filters

All data can be 'fed in' in parts. The filter will update itself and its estimation.

A model can be created and simulated. The results are plotted but the estimations can also be extracted if needed.

### Kalman

Filters a process using a Kalman filter.

### Particle

Filters a process using a particle filter.

## Examples

Look for examples in [the main code](main.py).
